Student Management System (Java + JDBC + MySQL)

📌 Project Overview
The Student Management System is a console-based backend application developed using Java, JDBC, and MySQL.  
It enables efficient management of student records through a menu-driven interface and supports complete **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations with persistent database storage.

This project is designed to demonstrate real-world backend development skills including database connectivity, prepared statements, looping applications, and terminal-based execution.


🎯 Objectives
- To understand Java–MySQL integration using JDBC
- To implement CRUD operations in a real application
- To build a menu-driven looping console program
- To gain hands-on experience with Git and GitHub
- To execute Java applications with external JAR files via terminal
